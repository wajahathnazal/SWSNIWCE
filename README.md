Secure Wireless Sensor Network Integration with Cloud Environment.
The project implements a cutting edge authentication, trust and reputation calculation system which can deal with all the issues previously discussed. The system carries out three main functionalities: Authenticating cloud service providers and the sensor network providers to avoid
malicious attack and help the user select the best cloud, Calculating the trust and reputation of the cloud service provider so that the system can calculate the best cloud for the cloud service user and Gathering the data from the sensor network providers and assisting them in selecting the
best cloud to store their data securely. A complete design and well derived functionalities are presented to establish the effectiveness of the Authenticated Trust and Reputation Calculation and Management system (ATRCM).
